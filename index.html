            <h1>...As a Professional</h1>
            <p>My career as a Software Engineer began in 2013, when I started making mods for the PC version of the
                game 'Skyrim'.
                This gave me my first experience with modelling tools, scripting, game design, etc. I eventually made
                many mods that I published
                onto the Steam Workshop for public download, where they now have more than 100,000 combined downloads. I
                had a lot of fun making these mods,
                mostly from learning the technologies needed to fix flaws in a game I care a lot about. This experience with improving software taught me that
                this was what I wanted to do with my career. 
            </p>
            <p>My formal education in programming began in my senior year of high school, where I learned the basics of
                computer science and solidified my thoughts
                that this was the field for me. In fall of 2016, I began college at West
                Virginia University, where I went on to receive a B.S. in Computer
                Science, as well as a minor in Entrepreneurial Studies. </p>
            <p>After graduating in December 2019, I have been working as an Associate Software Engineer for nCino, where I have been honing my technical skills and growing professionally.</p>

                    <h1>...As a Person</h1>
                    <p> I was born November 13th, 1997 in Dalton Georgia, a small town in the northwest of the state just south
                of Chattanooga Tennessee.
                When I was young, like many kids, I loved video games. I spent countless hours playing games like
                Pokemon and different sports games.
                This love for games stayed with me as I grew up, and when I was in high school, this appreciation for
                them motivated me to learn more about
                how games worked. This led me to learning more about software and computer hardware, and ultimately led
                me to choosing Computer Science as a major.
                <br>
                <br> Another passion that has been with me all my life is making music. I started learning the violin
                when I was in elementary school, but moved onto drumset
                before long. I also play the guitar, bass, and ukelele, albeit much more casually than my drumming. I've been in a few bands and can't wait to find my next one! 
                I also enjoy digital drawing and have started an apparel brand to showcase some of my favorite designs, <a href="https://www.scuffedco.com/" target="_blank">ScuffedCo.com</a>
