            <h1>...As a Professional</h1>

            <p>My career as a Computer Scientist began in 2013, when I started making mods for the PC version of the game 'Skyrim'. 
            This gave me my first experience with modelling tools, scripting, game design, etc. I eventually made many mods that I published
             onto the Steam Workshop for public download, and they now have more than 100,000 combined downloads. I had a lot of fun making these mods, 
             from learning the technologies needed to fixing flaws in a game I love,
             so when I saw people care about them and become popular, 
             
             
             I loved these little personal projects, especially learning new technologies and fixing flaws in my favorite game. This experience with improving software taught me that
             this was what I wanted to do with my life. Find ways to give people
             better experiences with their software, be it a game or a website or anything else. There is something immensely satisfying to me about identifying a problem, and fixing it to make a product better.
            </p>
            <h1 style="font-size: 28px;">"... this was what I wanted to do with my life..."</h1>
            <p>My formal education in coding began in my senior year of high school, where I learned the basics of computer science and solidified my thoughts
             that this was the field for me during an intro to java class. In fall of 2016, I began college at West Virginia University, where I am studying to receive a B.S. in Computer
              Science, as well as a minor in Entrepreneurial Studies. In my time at college, I have been lucky enough to have several opportunities in industry,
               including designing an ecommerce website for a multimillion dollar company with Myers Carpet, working with the Naval Nuclear Labs on a project to 
               increase resource allocation efficiency, and my most recent employment opportunity, working as a Development Support Intern with NextGen Federal
                Systems where I get to work with full time engineers on a full stack project to create a web app for internal use.</p>

            <h1>...As a Person</h1>

            <p> I was born November 13th, 1997 in Dalton Georgia, a small town in the northwest of the state just south of Chattanooga Tennessee. 
            When I was young, like many kids, I loved video games. I spent countless hours playing games like Pokemon and different sports games. 
            This love for games stayed with me as I grew up, and when I was in high school, this appreciation for them motivated me to learn more about
            how games worked. This led me to learning more about software and computer hardware, and ultimately led me to choosing Computer Science as a major.    
            
                <br>
                <br> Another passion that has been with me all my life is making music. I started learning the violin when I was in elementary school, but moved onto drumset
                before long. As of late I have been playing in two bands (Shotgun Surgeon and The Amplitude Endeavour), as well as learning more about music theory and electronic
                music in my free time.
