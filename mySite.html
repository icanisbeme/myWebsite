      <h1>...As a Professional</h1>
      
      <p>My career as a Computer Scientist began in 2013, when I started making mods for the PC version of the game 'Skyrim'. This gave me my first experience with
      modelling tools, scripting, game design, etc. I eventually made many mods that I published onto the Steam Workshop for download, and they now have a cumulative 
      of over 100,000 downloads. I had a lot of fun making these mods, so when I saw people care about them and become popular,
       I knew that this was what I wanted to do with my life. Find ways to give people better experiences through software.
      There is something immensely satisfying to me about identifying a problem, and fixing it to make a product better. 
      </p>
      <h1 style = "font-size: 28px;">"...I knew that this was what I wanted to do with my life..."</h1>
      <p>My education in coding began in my senior year of high school, where I learned the basics of computer science and solidified my thoughts that this was the field for me. 
      In Fall of 2016,   I began college at West Virginia University, where I am studying to receive a B.S. in Computer Science, as well as a minor in 
      Entrepreneurial Studies. In my time at college, I have been lucky enough to have several opportunities in industry, including designing an ecommerce 
      website for a multimillion dollar company with Myers Carpet, working with the Naval Nuclear 
      Labs on a project to increase resource allocation efficiency, and my most recent employment opportunity, working as a Development Support Intern with 
      NextGen Federal Systems where 
      I get to work with full time engineers on a full stack project to create a web app for internal use.</p>

      <h1>...As a Person</h1>

      <p> I was born November 13th, 1997 with the name Bond Ragsdale. I grew up in northwest Georgia, just south of Chattanooga Tennessee. 
      When I was young, like many kids, I loved video games. Pokemon holds an especially important place in my heart as it was not only 
      the first game I really played, but the first thing I ever bought (6 year old me really had to save up). This love of games stayed with me 
      throughout high school especially, and motivated me to looking into programming and computer hardware.
      <br>
      <br>
      Another passion of mine outisde of games is music. I play several instruments, including drumset, ukelele, and electric guitar. 
      I am currently playing drums in two bands, called Shotgun Surgeon and The Amplitude Endeavour. In the future I would love to go on tour and play 
      the kind of music I love for hundreds of people.
